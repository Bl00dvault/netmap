## Goal
Create a tool that can inject pcap data and display a network topology in a web page where further data enrichment can be input.
## Tasks
- [x] Added task:1: Develop a Python script to parse pcap data and extract information about each network device.  
- [x] Added task:2: Build a web application using a JavaScript framework that can render the network topology graphically using D3.js.
- [ ] Added task:3: Implement a RESTful API for the web application to allow for data enrichment input from users and integration with other tools.
- [x] Added task:Integrate the Python script with the JavaScript framework to display the network topology graphically, ensuring that the information extracted by the script is accurately reflected in the topology.
- [ ] Added task:Develop a user-friendly interface for the RESTful API, allowing users to easily input data enrichment and integrate with other tools.
- [ ] Added task:Develop a Python script that can extract network topology data from pcap files and output it in a format that can be easily integrated into the JavaScript framework for graphical rendering.
- [ ] Added task:Develop a data enrichment module that can process and incorporate user input data into the network topology generated by the Python script and displayed in the JavaScript framework, allowing for further analysis and visualization.
- [ ] Added task:Develop a data validation and cleaning module that can ensure the extracted network topology data from pcap files is accurate and complete before it is displayed in the JavaScript framework. This module should also be able to handle any errors or anomalies in the data and provide feedback to the user for further analysis and correction.
- [ ] Added task:Develop a feature that allows the user to export the enriched network topology data as a CSV file for further analysis outside of the web page.

- [ ] Added task:Develop a module that can import CSV files and convert them into the format required for display in the JavaScript framework. This module should also be able to handle any errors or anomalies in the data and provide feedback to the user for further analysis and correction.

- [ ] Added task:Develop a module that can analyze the pcap data and extract network topology information such as IP addresses, ports, protocols, and connections. This module should also be able to handle any errors or anomalies in the data and provide feedback to the user for further analysis and correction.
- [ ] Added task:Create a feature that can visualize the network topology based on the extracted information in a user-friendly way, such as a graph or diagram that can be interacted with. The feature should also be able to highlight any potential issues or threats in the network.
- [ ] Added task:Implement a functionality that allows the user to filter and manipulate the network topology data, such as by applying different criteria, grouping or sorting the data, or selecting specific nodes or edges. This functionality should be flexible and customizable to suit different user needs.
- [ ] Added task:Integrate a database or storage solution that can handle large volumes of pcap data and network topology information, and enable efficient searching, querying, and retrieval of the data. The solution should also be secure and scalable to meet future requirements.
- [ ] Added task:Develop a dashboard or interface that can provide a summary of the network topology data, such as statistics, trends, or alerts, and enable the user to take actions based on the insights. The dashboard should be intuitive and informative, and provide real-time updates and notifications.
